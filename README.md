# Text-Adventure-Game
A text-based adventure game inspired by Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.

Text Adventure Game Development Assignment


In this assignment, students are tasked with designing a text-based adventure game (Links to an external site.). This game should utilize the Python essentials covered thus far, including, but not limited to:

Strings and String Manipulation
User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
User Input and Input Handling
Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
Loops (for/while)
Controlling for Errors (try/except)


The working version of the game should include:

An executable script (a script that runs from beginning to end upon execution) that includes:
a game that can be successfully completed within a maximum of 3 minutes
â€¦a minimum of:
3 stages (maximum of 5 stages)
2 defined variables
1 loop
1 nested conditional statement
1 fail() function (executed whenever a user loses the game)
A docstring at the beginning of game that:
Is no more than 150 words
Introduces the game and its purpose
Identifies any bugs that are not yet worked out
 

Submission Requirements

A working version of your game in the following format:
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb format)
All code needs to be in a single cell
 

Restrictions

Your game must be based on a book, movie, or TV show. Make sure to provide a source.
No games based on Pokemon or hangman.
 

Restrictions (advanced)

As this is the first coding course in the MSBA program, the following restrictions have been put in place to ensure our focus is on mastering the fundamentals of Python.

The only programming language you may use is Python (no JavaScript, C, or other languages allowed).
Global variables may NOT be used (avoid things such as combat engines and character attributes such as health points).
No use of class structures or other object-oriented programming structures (you must stick to user-defined functions).
You are not allowed to pass things between the stages of your game (stages should not inherit arguments from other stages). For example, a key found in Stage 1 cannot be carried forward to Stage 2.
